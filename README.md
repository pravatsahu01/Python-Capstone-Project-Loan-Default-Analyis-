# Python-Capstone-Project-Loan-Default-Analyis-
This Capstone project is about vehicle loan deafult analysis for varoius customers for a large MNC bank. In this project i have done data exploration, data wrangling, data visualisation, studied the relation between variables and built logistic regression model method to predict the loan default status of bank's customer. Further i have evaluated the accuracy of the model using confusion matrix supervised machine learning model. The project was done in jupiter notebook. Addtionally visualization was done in Tableau to further study the data.

DESCRIPTION

Data Analysis is the process of creating a story using the data for easy and effective communication. It mostly utilizes visualization methods like plots, charts, and tables to convey what the data holds beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

Domain: Finance

Problem Statement

Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates.
The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.

There is 1 dataset data that have 41 attributes.
You are required to determine and examine factors that affected the ratio of vehicle loan defaulters. Also, use the findings to create a model to predict the potential defaulters.

Project Task Part 1: Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data:

Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings as the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
Variable names in the data may not be in accordance with the identifier naming in Python. Change the variable names accordingly.
The presented data might also contain missing values, therefore exploration will also lead to devising strategies to fill in the missing values. Devise strategies to do so whilst exploring the data.
 
Project Task Part 2: Performing EDA:

Provide the statistical description of the quantitative data variables
How is the target variable distributed overall?
Study the distribution of the target variable across the various categories such as branch, city, state, branch, supplier, manufacturer, etc.
What are the different employment types given in the data? Can a strategy be developed to fill in the missing values (if any)?  Use pie charts to express how different types of employment defines defaulter and non-defaulters.
Has age got something to do with defaulting? What is the distribution of age w.r.t. to defaulters and non-defaulters?
What type of ID was presented by most of the customers as proof?


Project Task Part 3: Performing EDA:

Study the credit bureau score distribution. How is the distribution for defaulters vs non-defaulters? Explore in detail.
Explore the primary and secondary account details. Is the information in some way related to loan default probability ?
Is there a difference between the sanctioned and disbursed amount of primary & secondary loans. Study the difference by providing apt statistics and graphs.
Do customer who make higher no. of enquiries end up being higher risk candidates? 
Is credit history, i.e. new loans in last six months, loans defaulted in last six months, time since first loan, etc., a significant factor in estimating probability of loan defaulters?
Perform logistic regression modelling, predict the outcome for the test data, and validate the results using the confusion matrix.

Project Task Part 4: Dashboarding:

Visualize the data using Tableau to help user explore data to create a better understanding
Demonstrate  the variables associated with each other and factors to build a dashboard
